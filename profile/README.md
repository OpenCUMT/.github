## Aspiration

🔓 **Open Source Spirit**: We firmly believe that [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is not just about sharing code. It represents a culture of **openness**, **inclusiveness**, and **sharing**. This spirit has become an important driving force behind technological advancement and social development, also emboding [the core values of socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Socialist_Values). We organized students to understand and participate in open-source projects, as the promotion to the dissemination and development of open-source culture on campus.

## Mission

💻 **Software Development**: We are dedicated to promoting open-source software development and maintenance globally. We provides **technical consulting services** to all students, teachers, colleges of the school, with the atmosphere of communication about technology and computer science. Whether you're coding your first app or fixing bugs, we're here to help!

🔧 **Open Source Maintenance**: We are active and engaged in contributing. From our own or other minor projects, Our members would gradually develop their skills through teamwork and hands-on practice.

🌍 **Campus Digitalization**: We are transforming our school into a **digital landscape**. From campus restoration to historical reconstruction, we use advanced software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview), [MineCraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) and [Lumion](https://lumion.com/), to build **virtual models** and **3D visualizations**. Our goal is to digitally archive our school and present its history through digital images.

🌐 **Intranet Services**: We are building a **comprehensive on-campus service site** to provide convenient services to all teachers and students in the school, based on the experience of our predecessors and the successful cases of other colleges and universities.

## Achievements

🌱 **Ecosystem Contribution**: Our members have made some progress in academic research and have participated in the maintenance of several open-source projects. Some members, as part of developer alliances and similar groups, have been providing long-term suggestions for companies and communities.

🌐 **Browser Home Page**: We've designed, developed and customized a **home page website** (inspired by [zjuers.com](https://zjuers.com)) for CUMT, with features of quick access to notifications and important websites, which changes dynamically over time and events.

🏛️ **Digital Legacy**: By utilizing digital modeling technology and researching historical data, we have recreated several historical buildings of CUMT. And we will continue to focus on showcasing the campus's past and future in the virtual world.
